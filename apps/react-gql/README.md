# GraphQL with ReactJS

- Move back to the project README.md [here](../../README.md)

## Description

- This app is a simple ReactJS app created with Vite to demonstrate the use of GraphQL in ReactJS environment.
- We are using `nest-gql` as the backend service for this app, you can change this from the config file available [here](./src/Config.ts). All three services are compatible with this app as they have the same GraphQL schema.

## Setting up the app

1. Navigate to the `apps/react-gql` folder in the terminal
2. Run `rushx start:dev` to start the service
3. App is running on `http://localhost:3011`
